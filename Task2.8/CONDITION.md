Create a program for processing text fragment of the textbook on programming using elements, for example: Symbol, Word, 
Sentence, Text, Paragraph, Listing, Lexem, Punctuation, etc.
The application should parse the text into elements with the obligatory possibility of recovering the text in its 
original form. 
You can use the Composite template.
In all tasks with the formation of text, it is allowed to replace tabs and sequences of spaces with one space.

Words of the text, beginning with vowels, are sorted alphabetically by the first consonant letter of the word.
